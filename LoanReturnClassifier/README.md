##Project Description

Can you predict whether a loan will be paid back or not based on a number of features? 

This project includes exploratory data analysis, data pre-processing, feature engineering and training and evaluation of the models. 
Original data (actual data is the same but the features have been modified slightly to create issues in data preprocessing etc) can be found here -  https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club

Models tested on the data include: 
*Multi-layer artificial neural network
*Decision Tree Classifier
*Random Forest Classifier
*Support Vector Machine
